- Instead of building and running everything, build and test only the
  modules that were affected by your change. Diff against git master to
  determine what changed.
- Concurrent compilation.
- Auto-update Bake (just check it into SC?)
- Support bake {module-name}.
- Support dynamically loading bake annotations and handler classes.
  - Use Bake's standard dependency scheme. For example, would could have:
    com.mycompany.MyAnnotation=mybakemodule
- Generate Javadocs.
- Support git submodules.
- Build and test everything that depends on code you changed.
- Generate Maven-compatible artifacts.
  - Tell Bake the version when building (so it can generate a pom).
  - Use "snapshot" otherwise.
- Verifies SDK of dependencies is compatible.
- Don't allow checkin until the tests have been run.
  - Hash differences from master. Write hash after tests pass.
- Download source code for transitive deps
  (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IVY-1003)
- Detect removed files and rebuild accordingly.
- Create .bake file from POM.
